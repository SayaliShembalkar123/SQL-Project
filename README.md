Library-Management-System using SQL Queries

Mini project to handle the operations of Library Management System using SQL queries 

Explanation of the Project
I have created library management system üìö. This system contains the information about students, books, transaction status,student book issue details .

The library has information about student:
i. student contact details,email,DOB,branch name
ii.books contain author name,book price,book id
iii. transaction status -"completed" or "pending"


The fine amount should be calculated basing on the issue date ,return date and due date.

The fine amount can be 5/- per day.

When a book is issued automatically it should reflect in the book table.

Modules in the Project

Return Book Section

Note
